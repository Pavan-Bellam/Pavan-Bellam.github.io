  "about": [
    "MS in Artificial Intelligence from RIT. I've spent years building production ML systems — from recommendation engines and computer vision pipelines to LLM-powered applications.",
    "My philosophy is simple: a model that only works in a Jupyter notebook is just an expensive experiment. I build systems that scale, handle edge cases, and work when the data gets messy."
